some interesting and newest NLP technique like tfidf weighted GLOVE was used yusing spacy library
TSNE visualization was also used
XGBoost was also implemented using randomsearch
LR and SVM were also used
all text preprocessing was done
nice work of feature engineering can also be seen
log loss and confusion matrix plotting was done
